I want to create an in-browser clicker idle game named IDLE TPOT. "TPOT" is an anagram that reads as "This Part of Twitter", and refers to my own niche twitter community. This game will serve as an homage to that community, and many of my mutuals.

INSPIRATION: Things that inspire the look and feel of this game.
- Universal Paperclips: A visually simple html / javascript game, one of the first idle clicker games. I want to pull the design simplicity from this game - it just runs.
- Cookie Clicker: One of the most popular clicker games. The upgrade path is simple, and the number going up is effective. 

CORE CLICKER GAMEPLAY: Click the Poast button to post a tweet. Each tweet will semi-randomly award you three currencies - LIKES, RTS and BOOKMARKS.
- LIKES: Common, highest amount rewarded, lowest worth
- RTS: Uncommon, medium amount rewarded, medium worth
- BOOKMARKS: Rare, low amount rewarded, high worth

STATS: There are three stats that your account has a small amount of to start, but you can purchase more. These stats are AURA, ALGO PULL, and CRACKED.
- LIKES buy AURA
- RTS buy ALGO PULL
- BOOKMARKS buy CRACKED
- Chances of a banger tweet going viral are decided with an equation that uses FOLLOW COUNT, AURA, ALGO PULL, CRACKED, and a random value as its variables
- LIKES are awarded as a function of FOLLOWERS, ALGO PULL and CRACKED
- RTS are awarded as a function of FOLLOWERS, AURA and CRACKED
- BOOKMARKS are awarded as a function of FOLLOWERS, AURA, ALGO PULL and CRACKED

FOLLOWERS: The overall reach of your account. You start with zero.
- Awarded as a function of AURA, ALGO PULL, CRACKED, and time since last Poast.
- The rate of new followers ramps down rapidly, reaching zero just a second after a Poast.

UPGRADES: Unlock different types of content for you to Poast about. Purchased with a combination of LIKES, RTS and BOOKMARKS.
